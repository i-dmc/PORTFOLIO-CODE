            <p>Safe Transport Victoria (STV) is responsible for ensuring the safety and regulation of the state’s
                transport systems, including public transport, roads, and maritime operations.</p><br>

            <p>With a heavily relied upon boating safety handbook available in PDF, STV requested this resource be
                turned into a native mobile application users can access offline.</p><br>

            <p>Our goal was to translate the handbook’s detailed content into a format that would be accessible,
                intuitive, and user-friendly.</p><br>

            <h5 class="about-heading">Discovery</h5>
            <section>
                <p>To align on the project’s goals and gather insights into the specific needs of the end-user, which
                    spanned a large and diverse audience of over 400,000 people, we carried out a discovery workshop
                    with the client. </p><br>

                <p>This workshop led us to understand the primary reasons users reference the handbook: self education
                    and staying on the right side of the law. Consequently, we were able to identify important chapters
                    and top tasks. Against this, we analysed the information architecture, retaining information that
                    aligned with the app’s requirements, and removing any that didn't. In addition to the above, the
                    client also identified this as an opportunity to increase the public’s understanding of their role
                    and presence. </p><br>

                <p>Overall, we established that the solution needed to:</p><br>

                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-point">Ensure a smooth and intuitive app, users can navigate easily.</li>
                    <li class="bullet-point">Highlight important sections of the handbook.</li>
                    <li class="bullet-point">Create a seamless transition between PDF and app.</li>
                </ul><br>

            <h5 class="about-heading">Solution</h5>
            <section>
                <p>With a solid understanding of the project, we got to designing the wireframes, taking a mobile first
                    approach.</p><br>
                <p>Quick links were added to the top of the homepage, allowing direct access to sections we recognised
                    were most important during discovery. Followed by a dedicated area for campaign banners and the 4
                    chapters selected for the app.</p><br>
                <p>Within the lower levels, we added ‘back’ and ‘next’ buttons to the top and bottom of each page,
                    mimicking chapters in a book. These were labelled with the relevant section’s title for additional
                    clarity. </p><br>
                <p>We colour coded chapters for easy navigation, applying one brand colour to each chapter.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Chapter buttons had accents of their respective colour to identification, with a full application on
                    hover for desktop.
                </p><br>
                <p>For additional engagement, we applied some fun visual elements to the design, including the Safe
                    Transport pattern and an ocean image in the background.</p><br>
                <p>The successful transformation of the STV maritime safety handbook marked a significant achievement
                    for both our team and the client. By leveraging key insights gained during the discovery phase, we
                    were able to create a user-friendly, accessible app that effectively met the needs of over 400,000
                    users.</p><br>
