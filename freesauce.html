            <p>Free Sauce is a lifestyle business mixing open source with tech consulting, the brief
                required a loose and flexible brand that was professional with a sense of satire. </p><br>

            <h5 class="about-heading">Discovery</h5>
            <section>
                <p>In order to execute this project, I sat down with Free Sauce's founder to understand his vision for
                    the brand and business.</p><br>

                <p>The idea behind Free Sauce stems from a commitment to open source, with the name itself
                    being a play on free and open source code. But beyond advocacy, Free Sauce operates as a
                    professional consulting service delivering real-world solutions for clients, particularly in the
                    government sector.</p><br>
                <p>This dual nature led us to one central design goal, balancing professionalism
                    and personality, and two objectives:
                </p><br>

                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-point">From a professional perspective (objective One), we were after a clean,
                        minimal design that was
                        simple to navigate.</li>
                    <li class="bullet-point">From a personality perspective (objective Two), we aimed to combine the
                        founder's love
                        of photography, commitment to open source, and a subtle homage to vintage aesthetics.
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
            </section>


            <section class="imagery">
                <img src="./Images/freesauce/polaroids.png" class="preview-img">
            </section>

            <h5 class="about-heading">Solution</h5>
            <section>

                <p></p>

                <p>To achieve the first objective, I focused on creating a clean and simple
                    layout with clear headings, uncluttered banners, a simple navigation of two items and plenty of
                    white space.</p><br>

                <p>Objective Two gave space for creative freedom to shine, allowing the brand’s personality
                    to come through in the use of colour, typography, and visual details.</p><br>

                <p>Cutive Mono serves as the brand’s primary typeface, used for headings and buttons throughout the
                    site. Its serif, monospaced design reflects the look and feel of both vintage typewriters and modern
                    code editors such as Visual Studio Code.</p><br>

                <p>The brand’s primary colour, a bold red, a nod to the tomato sauce–inspired name and
                    vintage 5¢ sticker logo, was applied sparingly to hover states and buttons. In
                    contrast, dark backgrounds were applied to banners to further mimic code editors and stand
                    out against the white space of the content.</p><br>

                <p>To highlight the founder’s passion for photography and add visual depth, personal snapshots were
                    incorporated into background banners and listing tiles. The tiles themselves were styled to resemble
                    Polaroids, with an engaging hover effect that transitions images from black and white to colour.
                </p><br>

                <p>Finally, for a personalised touch, the homepage opens with a minimal, portfolio-style entry point,
                    as if landing on a developer’s personal website, introducing users to the brand and its mission.</p>
                <br>

                <p>The final product, which is currently in development, successfully met the vision Free Sauce was
                    seeking, providing users with a simple, intuitive interface while reflecting the playful nature of
                    the
                    brand behind the business.</p>
